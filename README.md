## 📊 Project Overview / Headline
**Blinkit Grocery Data Analysis: Sales & Outlet Performance Dashboard**  
An interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze Blinkit’s grocery sales performance across **8,523 transactions**.  
The goal is to identify sales trends, understand outlet performance, and evaluate product-level insights for data-driven business decisions.

---

## 🎯 Short Description / Purpose
The **Blinkit Grocery Dashboard** is a Power BI report that visualizes grocery sales data to uncover insights into **outlet size, location tier, establishment year, and product attributes**.  
It helps business stakeholders optimize outlet performance, refine product strategy, and make better inventory decisions.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
The dashboard was developed using the following tools and technologies:

- **Power BI Desktop** – Main data visualization and reporting platform  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Used to create KPIs and calculated measures  
- **File Formats** – `.pbix` (dashboard), `.xlsx` (dataset), `.png` (visual previews)

> 💡 Note: Since the dataset contains only one table, **data modeling was not required**.  
> All transformations and calculations were handled directly in Power Query and DAX.

## 🗂️ Data Source
**Source:** BlinkIT Grocery Dataset (`Excel`, 8,523 records)

**Data Includes:**
- Item characteristics – Type, Fat Content, Visibility, Weight  
- Outlet attributes – Size, Location Tier, Establishment Year, Type  
- Performance metrics – Item Sales and Ratings  

The dataset was cleaned, standardized, and enhanced to prepare for KPI generation and visualization.

## 💡 Features / Highlights

### 🧩 Business Problem
Blinkit needed a consolidated, visual way to understand how **outlet characteristics** and **product attributes** affect sales.  
Without proper visualization, identifying the best-performing outlets or product categories was difficult.

**Key Questions:**
- Which outlet types and sizes generate the highest sales?  
- Do location tiers influence outlet performance?  
- Which item categories should be prioritized in marketing and restocking?

### 🎯 Goal of the Dashboard
To build a **dynamic, interactive Power BI dashboard** that:
- Provides a complete view of sales performance by outlet and item type  
- Highlights trends across outlet size, establishment year, and product characteristics  
- Enables **data-driven decisions** for outlet optimization and product strategy
